"2022-09-01","On September 1st, 2022, the colorectal cancer estimates for the 1992-2018 reference period were corrected for all age groups for the following geography: Canada excluding Quebec. The other estimates available remain unchanged."



Footnotes:
1,"Data sources include Statistics Canada's <a href = "http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3207&Item_Id=1633&lang=en" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Cancer Registry (opens new window)</a>.

Statistics Canada maintains the CCR which is comprised of data supplied by the provinces and territories whose cooperation is gratefully acknowledged."
2,"Cancer incidence refers to the number of new cases of primary malignant neoplasms in a population over a given period of time, usually one year. As the CCR is updated annually with new records for current and earlier diagnosis years as well as changes to previous records, the incidence for any given diagnosis year may change from one release to the next. In particular, delays in the reporting of new cases to Statistics Canada typically result in undercounts of cases which are more pronounced in the most recently reported diagnosis year. Generally, the reporting delay ranges between 2% and 3% nationally. The missing cases are added to their appropriate diagnosis year with the reporting of data from a new reference year."
3,"The table was prepared using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Groups for Primary Site based on the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3). Included are all invasive cancers and in situ for bladder. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rules for determining multiple primary types have been applied (source: International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, International Association of Cancer Registries, and European Network of Cancer Registries. International Rules for Multiple Primary Cancers, ICD-O Third Edition, Internal Report No.2004/02. Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer)."
4,"To reduce the number of duplicate cases, a national duplicate resolution process was completed which included cases diagnosed up to December 31, 2020 for all provinces and territories except Quebec and Nova Scotia. The de-duplication process was last completed for Quebec for all cases diagnosed up to December 31st, 2017. The de-duplication process was last completed for Nova Scotia for all cases diagnosed up to December 31st, 2019 (with incomplete incidence data for this last year)."
5,"All cancers combined refers to all invasive cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer but also including in situ bladder cancer."
8,"Quebec Cancer incidence data  are not available for diagnosis years after 2017 and Nova Scotia cancer incidence data are not available for diagnosis years after 2018. For tables 13-10-0111-01 and 13-10-0747-01, annual case count and rate estimates for Quebec and Canada for the 2018 diagnosis year onward are not provided. Likewise, annual case counts and rate estimates for Nova Scotia and Canada excluding Quebec for the 2019 diagnosis year onward are not provided."
10,"Although the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) strives to achieve national uniformity, reporting procedures and completeness still vary across the country. Specific issues follow: a) Differences may exist between the content of the CCR and the provincial/territorial cancer registries because of incomplete updating of the CCR by the provinces and territories. b) Ontario has no death certificate only (DCO) cases reported in 2020 (around 1,150 cases were reported in 2019). c) Manitoba has not systematically reported DCO cases since 2013 (43 cases were reported in 2012). d) Newfoundland and Labrador did not report DCO cases until 2006."
11,"In October 2014, Ontario implemented a new cancer reporting system, the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR). The new system has several enhancements that permit the identification of cancer cases that previously went unrecorded. These include the use of more liberal rules for counting multiple primary sites, the use of additional source records and the inclusion of records that were previously not included. The implementation of this new system affects data from the 2010 diagnosis year onward."
6,"To prevent inappropriate disclosure of health-related information, the actual number of cases of a specific cancer is randomly rounded to a lower or higher multiple of 5; true zeros and actual counts evenly divisible by 5 are not affected. Random rounding is applied to each cell count independently. Specifically, an unbiased random rounding procedure is applied such that numbers ending in 0 or 5 are not rounded; numbers ending in a 1 or 6 are rounded up with a probability of 0.20 and down with a probability of 0.80; numbers ending in 2 or 7 are rounded up and down with probabilities of 0.40 and 0.60, respectively; numbers ending in 3 or 8 are rounded up and down with probabilities of 0.60 and 0.40, respectively; and, numbers ending in 4 or 9 are rounded up and down with probabilities of 0.80 and 0.20, respectively. Consequently, columns and rows will sum to totals only by chance. By design, differences between the rounded and actual counts will never exceed 4 and actual counts are more likely to be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5. The randomly rounded number of cases is used to calculate the incidence rate and 95% confidence limits."
7,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, and (...) for figures not applicable."
9,"Cancer incidence rates for both sexes were produced using the total population estimate for both males and females even for sex-specific primary cancers (for example, prostate, cervix uteri, testis, and ovary)."
