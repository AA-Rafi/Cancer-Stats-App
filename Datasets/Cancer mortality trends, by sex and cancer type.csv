Statistics Canada maintains the CVSD which is composed of data supplied by the provinces and territories whose cooperation is gratefully acknowledged."
2,"Cancer mortality refers to the number of deaths attributed to malignant neoplasms in a population over a given period of time, usually one year. It is typically reported per 100,00 people."
3,"Death counts were unavailable for the Yukon territory for the 2017-2020 reference period. Cancer death counts were imputed by randomly assigning cancer deaths from the 2012 to 2016 period to the 2017 to 2021 period and retaining the data from 2017 to 2020."
4,"Cancer mortality rates are age-standardized using the direct method and the final 2011 Canadian postcensal <a href ="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/statistical-programs/document/3207_D12_V4">population structure</a>. <a href= "http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/btd/asr">Age-standardization</a> allows for comparisons of mortality rates over time that are unaffected by changes in the age distribution of the population. The age-standardized rate may be undefined in the event that the underlying population of one or more age groups is 0."
5,"Joinpoint analysis was applied to annual age-standardized mortality rates (1984 to 2020) to determine years in which the annual percent change changed significantly. Such years delimit successive trends and are referred to as changepoints. The minimum time span on which to report a trend was set at five years."
6,"Using the National Cancer Institute's JoinPoint Regression Program, version 4.6.0.0,  the annual percent change was calculated for each cancer type by fitting a piecewise linear model that assumed a constant rate of change in the logarithm of the annual age-standardized rate in each segment."
7,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, (...) for figures not applicable and (x) for figures suppressed to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act."
8,"For this trend, the annual percent change (APC) is in fact an average annual percent change (AAPC) corresponding to the weighted average of the trends of the best-fitting model over the period of interest."
9,"In this table, years are displayed with thousands separators because they are formatted as numbers. The commas will disappear upon downloading the table.
"
10,"Confidence intervals convey the degree of accuracy associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals convey inaccuracy (i.e., high variability) and should be interpreted and compared cautiously. The models incorporated estimated standard errors of the age-standardized rates and the tests of significance used a Monte Carlo permutation method."
12,"Since cancer incidence data for Quebec are not available for diagnosis years 2011 onward, a mortality trend series for Canada excluding Quebec was created to make direct comparison with cancer incidence possible."
11,"The table summarizing all cancer definitions across classification schemes can be found here: <a href = "https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/document/3207_D13_V1" > Cancer Definitions </a>."
